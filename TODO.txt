- Testing!!!!!!!!

Major changes before 0.2.0
- Review start(), cancel() and 'auto' option
  - Don't make the ID mandatory
    - start(): Without the ID parameter it will check if there is
      no queue running => start it!
    - cancel(): Without the ID parameter will stop que queue (if running),
      and call cancel() for any uploading files
    
  - Remove cancellAll()
    - It will work the same as cancel() with no arguments
    
  - Review the 'auto' option, and how the queue is processed with the
    new start() and cancell() from previous points
  - Also, before start the upload of a file coming from queue check
    that is  not uploading already.
